# 1st-assignment-Micro-II
This repository was created within the 1st assignment. Contains the source code of one of my previous projects. 

This code was written for a gas sensor, measures the amount of smoke and other harmful gases in the air. If it reaches some predefined tresholds the user is alarmed by led diodes ( green - be aware, yellow - the concentration of the gas is increasing, red - leave the place, the health risk is high) and also by a buzzer.

The values are visualized through an LCD display. 

The project was tested and handed in as a part of the 3rd assignment from the subject Microcontroller technology I.
